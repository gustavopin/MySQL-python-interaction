# Database Creation with Python

This project extend the knowledge of python programming while inserting SQL commands to communicate with a local server created from MySQL.
It involves creating databases, tables, inserting and extracting elements so they can be organized in a visually pleasent way.

## Phase 1

- This phase is the creation of the MySQL connection with the MySQL Workbench. This allow the creation of databases inside this connections to store the data within its tables.
    - The creation of the database can be found [here](DatabaseFiles\creating_database.py).
    - The creation of the tables can be found [here](DatabaseFiles\creating_tables.py).
    - [This code is a test to see if the database works](DatabaseFiles\reading_database.py).

## Phase 2

- Create and insert data within the databases created.
    - [Insertion of students info](DatabaseFiles\inserting_data_names.py).
    - [Insertion of students grades](DatabaseFiles\inserting_data_grades.py).
    
## Phase 3

- Extract the data from the database and organize it.
    - [Extraction can be found here](WorkingWithTheData\extracting_data.py).

## Phase 4

- Working with the data.
    - [The 'Working With Data' part can be found here](WorkingWithTheData\data_analysis.py).
